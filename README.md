# Introduction

This is a GUI project in VS Code. The project uses JButtons to generate promps. It rolls a variety of dice, generates different character stats for Dungeons and Dragons characters, and it also can generate prompts for encounters. The dice function can be used for any Table Top RolePlaying Game, however it was primarily made for Dungeons and Dragons.
